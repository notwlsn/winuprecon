# Disclaimer <br>
I'm probably not the first person to think of this or use a script like this. I'm just putting it up here for general community use. I'm sure I don't 'own' this code, I certainly don't claim to.

# Background <br>
I've seen this concept used a lot by Chinese APT groups, specifically APT17 and APT19.
